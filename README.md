   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jewelry-ethical-sourcing
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Deploy contracts to testnet:
   \`\`\`bash
   clarinet deploy --testnet
   \`\`\`

### Testing

npm test mining-certification
npm test labor-standards
npm test environmental-compliance
npm test consumer-transparency
\`\`\`

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Supplier
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .supplier-verification register-supplier
"Ethical Gems Ltd"
"Sierra Leone"
"contact@ethicalgems.com"
(list "ISO14001" "Fairtrade"))
\`\`\`

### Creating a Product
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .consumer-transparency create-product
"Ethical Diamond Ring"
"Beautiful ring with full ethical sourcing"
u1 u1 u1 u1
(list "Diamond" "Gold")
u5000)
\`\`\`

### Verifying Product Transparency
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .consumer-transparency get-transparency-score u1)
\`\`\`

## Transparency Scoring

The system calculates transparency scores based on:
- Supplier verification status (10 points)
- Mining certification level (10 points)
- Labor standards compliance (10 points)
- Environmental compliance rating (10 points)
- Base transparency score (60 points)

**Maximum Score:** 100 points

## Compliance Levels

### Supplier Verification
- **Pending** (0): Awaiting verification
- **Verified** (1): Fully verified supplier
- **Suspended** (2): Temporarily suspended
- **Revoked** (3): Verification revoked

### Mining Certification
- **None** (0): No certification
- **Basic** (1): Basic ethical standards
- **Advanced** (2): Enhanced standards
- **Premium** (3): Highest certification level

### Labor Standards
- **None** (0): Non-compliant
- **Basic** (1): Basic compliance
- **Good** (2): Good compliance
- **Excellent** (3): Excellent compliance

### Environmental Rating
- **Poor** (1): Below standards
- **Fair** (2): Meets minimum standards
- **Good** (3): Above average
- **Excellent** (4): Exceptional performance
